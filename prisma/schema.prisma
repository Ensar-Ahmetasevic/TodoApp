// In the Todo model, the user field is added to create a "many-to-one" relationship with the User model. The userId field is added as
// a foreign key to store the id of the associated User record. In the User model, the todos field is added as a virtual field to define
// the reverse relationship with the Todo model. This allows you to fetch all the todos associated with a user by accessing the todos
// field on a User record.
